This project is to create a messeger app that will connect to a privately owned/operated server(s) that either the user or someone
that they know has set up the server. Current;y the plan is to only handle text messages, but I plan on to add handling of sending
pictures as I learn more about socket programming. I will also create a sister software for the server that will handle routing the
messages to the right users.
